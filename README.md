# CDISC [SDTM, ADaM, Define.xml] metadata management using R programming 
## Various open-source technologies enabling innovation in clinical trial has matured over the past few years. One major concept is CDISC metadata management at various level [Company, Compound, Study] while ensure Quality, Transparency, Traceability, and Compliance with regulatory agencies across the globe.  

## Metacore by Atrous: Metadata management using R programming 
## Manage CDISC SDTM, ADaM, Define.xml metadata
## This concept builds upon industry standards process for creating SDTM and ADaM specification which are used to create SDTM and ADaM programs and datasets. Furthermore, the SDTM and ADaM specifications can be further leveaged to create Data Submission package including aCRF annotation, SDRG, ADRG, ARM, and respective define.xml documentations. This process increases adherence to Data and Submission standards.
